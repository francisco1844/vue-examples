# vue-examples

Collection of Vue.js reference examples for teaching and learning Vue. These examples assume NO experience of front end by the reader. 

The early examples 1-15, are intentionally simple while the remainder start using VUE cli and NUXT which are more sophisticated patterns (they generate complex starting projects) that it is helpful to build up to. VUE cli is what an experienced front end developer may use if they are unfamiliar with Vue and Nuxt would be used by an intermediate Vue Front End engineer as it provides more benefits as well as more complexity. 

This is a fork from the original by [Peter Lamar](https://github.com/peterlamar/vue-examples).That repository has not been updated in years and pull requests seem to be getting ignored.  I am someone who is on a similar situation to the original author in that I had more experience as a backend engineer and as a DBA. 

Since these examples are several years old they are possibly, even likely, in Vue 2 so I be updating them as I go through them.

I have also renamed folders, multiplying by 10, from original names. That will make it easier to add new chapters in between existing ones.

## Introduction

These examples can be accessed by opening the index.html file within your browser. The related javascript and css files are referenced by this file when appropriate. This is a good way to test javascript and Vue snippets found on the web.


1. [Hello World](10-helloworld)
2. [Instance](20-instance)
3. [Vbind](30-bind)
4. [Computed](40-computed)
5. [Watcher](50-watcher)
6. [Class](60-class)
7. [Events](70-events)
8. [Vmodel](80-vmodel)
9. [Component](90-component)
10. [ComponentMessage](100-componentmessage)
11. [ComponentDynamic](110-componentdynamic)
12. [Async](120-async)

## Charts and Graphs

These are interesting if you wish to jumpstart into data visualization. 

1. [Chart](130-chart)
2. [Vuechart](150-vuechart)
3. [Vuebars](150-vuebars)

## Vue CLI
**Note by Francisco Reyes: VUE cli is no longer the preferred method to setup a Vue application so will be updating this section to relect that as I get to this later chapters**

These examples start with the [VUE cli](https://cli.vuejs.org/) and represent the beginnings of the single page app pattern. This pattern differs from the index.html file in that javascript files are separated out into .vue files which is easier to maintain in larger projects. 

1. [LocalProxy](160-localproxy)
2. [AGGrid](170-aggrid)
3. [tailwind](180-tailwind)
4. [svgdots](190-svgdots)
5. [d3connectdots](200-d3connectdots)
6. [firebasechat](210-firebase-chat)

## Nuxt

The [Nuxt](https://nuxtjs.org/) project is an attempt to improve on the Vue cli by providing some common settings as defaults in the generated project.

1. [HelloNuxt](220-hellonuxt)
2. [todo-app](230-todo-app)
